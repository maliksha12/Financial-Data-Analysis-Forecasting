## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Prophet, ARIMA  
- **Power BI**: KPIs, DAX, Interactive Dashboards  
- **SQL / Excel**: Data cleaning & preprocessing  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Features
- Conducted **time-series forecasting** using Prophet/ARIMA, achieving ~92% accuracy (MAPE < 8%).  
- Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** with KPIs: Closing Price, Volume, Moving Averages, Forecasts.  
- Automated **data cleaning and preprocessing workflows** for accuracy and consistency.  
- Delivered an **end-to-end integrated solution** (Python + Power BI) to reduce manual reporting effort by 70% and enable faster insights.
